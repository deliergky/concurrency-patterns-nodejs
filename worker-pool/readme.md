# Worker Pool

## Common use Cases

1. Task Queues in Distributed Systems: Workers pull tasks from the queue and process them. This pattern is useful for balancing load and ensuring high availability and scalability.

2. API Rate Limiting: This helps in managing resource utilization and preventing abuse.

3. Data Processing in Big Data Applications: Distributing data processing tasks across a pool of workers to handle large datasets more efficiently.
